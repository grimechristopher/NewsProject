      "Full content: Israeli forces kill 67 Palestinians seeking aid in northern Gaza, Hamas-run ministry says5 hours agoShareSaveYolande KnellMiddle East correspondentReporting fromJerusalemJack BurgessBBC NewsShareSaveReutersPalestinians pictured carrying aid supplies in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, on SundayThe Israeli military has killed at least 67 people waiting for UN aid lorries in northern Gaza, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.The UN World Food Programme said its 25-truck convoy \"encountered massive crowds of hungry civilians which came under gunfire\", soon after it crossed from Israel and cleared checkpoints.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that it had \"fired warning shots\" to remove \"an immediate threat\". It disputed the number of reported deaths.On Saturday the ministry warned that extreme hunger was increasing in Gaza and growing numbers of people were arriving at its facilities \"in a state of extreme exhaustion and fatigue\".\"We warn that hundreds of people whose bodies have wasted away are at risk of imminent death due to hunger,\" it said. The UN has also said civilians in Gaza are starving and called for an urgent influx of essential goods.On Sunday the ministry said it had recorded 18 deaths \"due to famine\" over the past 24 hours.Many of the casualties from northern Gaza were taken to Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The medical director there, Dr Hassan al-Shaer, told BBC Arabic on Sunday the facility had been \"overwhelmed\".Outside the hospital one woman told BBC Arabic that \"the whole population is dying\".\"Children are dying of hunger because they have nothing to eat. People are surviving on water and salt… just water and salt,\" she said.In an updated death toll, Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli fire had killed a total of 93 people and wounded dozens more across Gaza on Sunday. Eighty people were killed in northern Gaza, it said, while nine people were shot dead near an aid point in Rafah and four more near an aid point in Khan Younis, both in southern Gaza.In Gaza City, Qasem Abu Khater told AFP he had attempted to get a bag of flour but instead found a desperate crowd and \"deadly overcrowding and pushing\".\"The tanks were firing shells randomly at us and Israeli sniper soldiers were shooting as if they were hunting animals in a forest,\" he said.\"Dozens of people were martyred right before my eyes and no one could save anyone.\"The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) condemned violence against civilians seeking aid as \"completely unacceptable\".In a statement posted on X, the WFP said \"malnutrition is surging with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment\". \"Nearly one person in three is not eating for days,\" it said. There have been almost daily reports of Palestinians being killed while seeking food since late May. On Saturday at least 32 people were killed by Israeli gunfire near two aid distribution points in southern Gaza, according to the ministry.Many of the incidents have taken place near sites run by the controversial US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which uses private security contractors to distribute aid from sites in Israeli military zones, but some have taken place near aid brought in by the UN.Getty ImagesPeople gathered near Shifa hospital as the bodies of those killed waiting for aid were brought inMeanwhile the Israeli military has issued evacuation orders for a crowded part of central Gaza where it has not launched a ground offensive during its 21 months of war against Hamas.The IDF said on Sunday that residents and displaced Palestinians sheltering in the city of Deir al-Balah should evacuate immediately and move towards al-Mawasi on the Mediterranean coast.The evacuation demand, which could signal an imminent attack, has caused widespread panic among tens of thousands of Palestinians, as well as the families of Israeli hostages who fear their relatives are being held in the city.The IDF has conducted air strikes in the area, but it has not yet deployed ground troops. On Sunday, the Israeli military dropped leaflets from the sky ordering people in several districts in southwest Deir al-Balah to leave their homes and head further south.\"The (Israeli) Defense Forces continues to operate with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure in the area,\" the military said, adding that it had not yet entered these districts during the war.The affected neighbourhoods of Deir al-Balah are crowded with displaced people living in tents.Israeli sources told Reuters news agency that the reason the army has stayed out of these districts so far is because they suspect Hamas might be holding hostages there.At least 20 of the remaining 50 hostages in captivity in Gaza are believed to still be alive.Most of the Strip's population of more than two million people have been displaced at least once during Israel's war with Hamas, with repeated Israeli evacuation calls covering large parts of the territory.On Sunday, Pope Leo XIV called for an \"immediate end to the barbarity of the war\" and urged against \"indiscriminate use of force\". His comments came days after a deadly Israeli strike hit Gaza's only Catholic Church, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country deeply regretted.Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and led to 251 others being taken hostage.Israeli attacks have since killed more than 58,895 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry's figures are quoted by the UN and others as the most reliable source of statistics available on casualties.Dozens killed by Israeli gunfire near aid sites in south Gaza, Hamas-run ministry saysIsrael says it regrets deadly strike on Catholic Church in GazaMiddle EastIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesHamas\n",

      "Full content:        A bloodstain remained on the sidewalk where a car crashed into a crowd in front of the Vermont Club in East Hollywood, injuring 30. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)       By Grace Toohey, Jessica Garrison and Richard Winton   July 20, 2025  Updated 6:57 PM PT                 16               Share via     Close extra sharing options         Email        Facebook        X        LinkedIn        Threads        Reddit        WhatsApp        Copy Link URL Copied!        Print           The driver who police say intentionally plowed into a crowd early Saturday outside a popular East Hollywood music venue was previously convicted of a hate crime in Orange County, a conviction subsequently overturned by an appeals court, according to prosecutors and court records.Fernando Ramirez was 23 when, on June 15, 2019, he entered a Whole Foods Market in Laguna Beach and sucker-punched a 26-year-old Black employee who’d been on a lunch break, breaking the man’s nose and severely damaging his two front teeth, according to reports at the time of the incident. When asked by an officer why he did it, Ramirez said in a conversation recorded on video that it was, in part, because the worker was Black, and that “he hated all Black people,” court records show.  Advertisement    It is part of a lengthy criminal record that Ramirez accumulated in the years leading up to Saturday night’s attack. Prosecutors in Orange County have filed 11 criminal cases over the past 11 years against him, including several violent charges. Ramirez had been thrown out of the Vermont Hollywood club before returning to the area in a vehicle around 2 a.m. Saturday, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. His vehicle hit street vendors and dozens of the late-night clubgoers, according to police, causing several medical emergencies and stoking fear and anger among the crowd. Bystanders pulled Ramirez from his vehicle and attacked him — video showed him being punched and kicked — and, at some point, he was shot, LAPD officials said.  Advertisement    LAPD Capt. Ben Fernandes said that, as nightclub security attempted to detain Ramirez after he left behind a chaotic and bloody scene, another man came from across the street and shot the driver in the buttocks. Officer Norma Eisenman, an LAPD spokesperson, said on Sunday that the gunman remained at large. He was described as male, Latino, about 5-foot-7 and 150 to 170 pounds. He was last seen wearing a blue Dodgers jacket, a light blue jersey with the number “5” and blue jeans. He had gauges in both ears and a goatee. Ramirez, who is expected to face several felony charges, had recovered from surgery for his injuries and was in stable condition, Fernandes said. Advertisement    Officials reported about 30 other people with injuries, including seven who were critically injured. At least 23 people were hospitalized. An LAPD spokesperson said on Sunday that the agency did not have any update on the victims’ conditions. Given the size of the crowd, Fernandes said the incident could have easily spiraled into a mass casualty event.“Quite honestly, I believe it is a miracle,” Fernandes told NBC-4 News.One witness told ABC-7 News that he saw dozens of people on the ground after the crash. Another said it was “like a movie.”“You see shoes flying, you see change, money, there’s hot dog stands that were outside the bar … they got hit,” the witness said.Eduardo Lopez, who was working at his taco truck down the street from the nightclub early Saturday, said he heard the crash and the subsequent screams.

The appeals court reversed the civil rights violation and the hate crime enhancement and vacated the sentence, but upheld the aggravated battery conviction because it was “not affected by the Miranda error.”In 2020, Ramirez was convicted of a 2019 battery upon a police officer and resisting arrest and got 180 days in jail.In 2021, he was convicted of assault with great bodily injury and two counts of resisting arrest and received a sentence of 194 days in jail and a year of probation. That same year, he pleaded guilty to corporal injury upon a spouse and was sentenced to three years of probation with 234 days in jail.

WABCA suspect is in custody for the shooting of an off-duty United States Border Patrol agent just before midnight on Saturday in a New York City park under the George Washington Bridge, authorities said.The shooting unfolded at 11:51 p.m. Saturday in Fort Washington Park in the Washington Heights neighborhood of upper Manhattan, according to the New York Police Department.The 42-year-old Border Patrol agent, who was shot in the face and arm, was taken to Harlem Hospital, where he is being treated and is expected to survive, authorities said.Crime scene investigators search for evidence after an off-duty U.S. Border Patrol agent was shot and wounded, July 20, 2025, in New York City's Fort Washington Park during what police suspect was a robbery.WABCThe shooting occurred near the Little Red Lighthouse in Fort Washington Park, which is directly beneath the George Washington Bridge, police said. The attack was captured on security video, which helped police quickly catch the suspect, authorities said.A witness told police that she and the off-duty agent were sitting together on the rocks near the edge of the Hudson River when the suspect and his accomplice approached them on a scooter, according to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The security video, posted on social media by the DHS, showed two men on a scooter stop near where the victim and the witness were sitting. The passenger is seen in the footage getting off the scooter and approaching the victim while the driver stayed with the scooter.New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a news conference Sunday afternoon that the video showed the suspected shooter, identified as 21-year-old Miguel Francisco Mora Nunez, drawing a firearm and the Border Patrol agent also pulling out a handgun to defend himself.\"The officer realized that he was being robbed and drew his service weapon in defense,\" Tisch said.Tisch said the suspect opened fire first and that there was an exchange of gunfire before the suspect appeared to limp back to his alleged accomplice and the two drove away on the scooter.Tisch said Mora Nunez walked into a hospital in the Bronx at 12:18 a.m. with gunshot wounds to the groin and the leg that she said was \"consistent with the injuries sustained\" by the perpetrator in the security video.A crime scene investigator searches for evidence after an off-duty U.S. Border Patrol agent was shot and wounded, July 20, 2025, in New York City's Fort Washington Park during what police suspect was a robbery.WABCThe commissioner said it does not appear that the Border Patrol agent was targeted because of his job.Mora Nunez underwent surgery and is in custody at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, Tisch said. She said the suspect is expected to be arrested later Sunday.The initial police investigation has determined that the suspect, who DHS said is from the Dominican Republic, entered the country illegally in Arizona from Mexico in 2023, according to Tisch.ABC News has not independently confirmed the suspect’s immigration status or criminal recordTisch said Mora Nunez has two prior arrests for domestic violence in New York and has an active warrant for missing a court date on one of the cases.Mora Nunez is also wanted by the NYPD for a robbery in December 2024 and a felony assault stabbing in January 2025. Both of those incidents occurred in the Bronx.MORE: Mayor Eric Adams meets with Trump border czar to talk NYC's role in new immigration policy“In less than one year, he has inflicted violence in our city and once he's charged for last night's crimes, we will be able to add attempted murder to his rap sheet,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said at Sunday's news conference.The suspect is also wanted in Massachusetts for allegedly stealing guns from a pawn shop in February 2025, Tisch said.Tisch said the suspect's accomplice is still at large.MORE: Suspects in Border Patrol agent's killing in Vermont surveilled for days, had cellphones wrapped in foilAdams said he visited the wounded Border Patrol agent in the hospital on Sunday and that the officer is expected to make a full recovery.The New York shooting comes roughly two weeks after a gunman opened fire at the entrance to the Border Patrol sector annex in McAllen, Texas.The suspect in the July 7 shooting, identified as 27-year-old Ryan Louis Mosqueda, fired \"many rounds\" at the federal building that houses the U.S. Border Patrol office at the McAllen International Airport, according to McAllen Police Chief Victor Rodriguez.The suspect was confronted and killed by Border Patrol agents and local police, according to McAllen police and the DHS.Two police officers and a Border Patrol employee were injured in the attack, according to the DHS.The motive for the McAllen shooting remains under investigation.ABC News' Armando Garcia and Jack Date contributed to this report.Related TopicsNew YorkImmigrationSponsored Content by Taboola\n",

SchmidtJuly 20, 2025Updated 4:25 p.m. ETIt was the summer of 1996 when Maria Farmer went to law enforcement to complain about Jeffrey Epstein.At the time, she said, she had been sexually assaulted by Mr. Epstein and his longtime partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. Ms. Farmer, then in her mid-20s, had also learned about a troubling encounter that her younger sister — then a teenager — had endured at Mr. Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. And she described facing threats from Mr. Epstein.Ms. Farmer said that when she discussed her concerns with the New York Police Department, then with the F.B.I., she also urged them to take a broader look at the people in Mr. Epstein’s orbit, including Donald J. Trump, then still two decades from being elected president. She repeated that message, she said, when the F.B.I. interviewed her again about Mr. Epstein in 2006.Her account is among the clearest indications yet of how Mr. Trump might have come to be named in the unreleased investigative files in the Epstein case, a matter that has generated another political uproar in recent weeks.In interviews over the past week about what she told the authorities, Ms. Farmer said she had no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Mr. Epstein’s associates. But she said she was alarmed by what she saw as Mr. Epstein’s pattern of pursuing girls and young women while building friendships with prominent people, including Mr. Trump and President Bill Clinton.Investigations like the ones that targeted Mr. Epstein often explore a wide range of tips, evidence, recollections and relationships, little of which ends up being used in court records or as the basis for criminal prosecution. Mr. Epstein’s voluminous investigative file contains many records that have not been made public, but that became the focus of claims, long stoked by Mr. Trump’s allies, that authorities might have covered up the involvement of other rich and powerful men.We are having trouble retrieving the article content.Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "Full content: Number of missing in deadly Texas floods drops to three6 hours agoShareSaveMadeline HalpertBBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesAt one point, over 160 people were marked as missing after the floodwaters swept through south central TexasThe number of people missing in Texas after devastating floods hit the state has dropped from 160 people to three, officials said.  The flash floods following a torrential downpour on 4 July killed 135 people in, including children at Camp Mystic, a Christian all-girls' summer camp along the Guadalupe River.Dozens of others were reported missing. But on late Saturday, the city of Kerrville, at the heart of the disaster, reported that many had been verified as safe. Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said that it took \"countless hours of coordinated search and rescue operations, careful investigative work, and an unwavering commitment to bringing clarity and hope to families\".  In a Facebook post, the city said ,000 federal, state and local officials had worked \"tirelessly\" to track down the missing and that search teams were now reuniting them with their families.Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring, Jr. said in the post: \"Our thoughts remain with the families still awaiting news, and we will continue to stand with them as efforts persist.\"Earlier this week, officials said the number of people who were missing had fallen from 160 to 100 in Kerr County - the hardest hit area - and nearby areas thanks to the help of thousands of rescuers. Officials said many people who were initially reported as missing had been verified as safe and were removed from the list. At Camp Mystic, at least 27 campers and counselors died after the Guadalupe River flooded from the torrential rains. The river rose 26ft (8m) in the span of just 45 minutes as young children, staff and residents slept in homes along the river. In the wake of the deadly tragedy, questions were raised about whether adequate warnings were provided and why camps weren't evacuated ahead of the deluge.Experts have said a number of factor led to the deadly impact of the flash flood, including the pre-dawn timing, the location of some homes, the patchwork of cell service and its overall speed and severity.President Donald Trump visited the wreckage last week to express his \"love and support\" for those who had been affected, dismissing questions about whether more could have been done to warn residents.

      "Full content: A car inundated by floodwaters along East-West Highway in Silver Spring, Maryland, on Saturday. (Dave Dildine)By  Jeff Halverson and Jason SamenowSeveral parts of the northern half of the Washington area were overwhelmed by flash flooding late Saturday afternoon and evening because of intense, slow-moving thunderstorms. Silver Spring, Maryland, and Great Falls, Virginia, were the hardest hit after 5 to 5½ inches fell in less than two hours. Flooding also extended into northern areas of D.C. and Prince George’s County.The deluge caused waterways to overflow their banks, transformed roads into rivers and stranded vehicles in high water. The torrents were fueled by exceptional humidity levels that have hovered at near-record marks for weeks. Atmospheric moisture is on the rise because of human-caused climate change, increasing flood risks.As vast volumes of water poured into area streams, they rose with remarkable haste. A sensor along Sligo Creek, which winds through Silver Spring and Takoma Park, reported a 10-foot rise in water in just 30 minutes. The creek crested at its highest level in at least 20 years in Takoma Park.AdvertisementArea watersheds such as Sligo Creek were under significant stress from days of heavy rain over the past week. With soil saturated, the tipping point to the flash flood stage was rapidly reached.Because of the abrupt water rise and ongoing downpour, the National Weather Service declared a flash flood emergency — its most dire flood alert — for Silver Spring and its surroundings. It was the first such alert ever issued for that particular area (the Weather Service began issuing flash flood emergencies in 2003).Dozens of water rescues were carried out in southern Montgomery County; many around Silver Spring and spanning from Potomac to Takoma Park, according to Pete Piringer, chief spokesperson for the county’s fire and rescue service.The flooding in Great Falls closed portions of Georgetown Pike and prompted rescues of multiple people stranded in high water on Old Dominion Road.AdvertisementFlooding was also reported in northern Prince George’s County around Hyattsville and College Park.Peak rainfall rates reached at least 2 to 4 inches per hour. College Park registered a record hourly amount of 2.71 inches between 5 and 6 p.m.A large area from roughly Great Falls to Greenbelt, Maryland, received at least two inches of rain.How the flooding unfoldedThrough much of the day, the region’s main flash flood concern had been focused on central Virginia, where a flood watch was in effect. The sudden jump in flood threat 50 or so miles to the north, in the late afternoon, came as a surprise.A stalled front, which was located to the south of D.C. during the early morning, surged northward. By late afternoon, it had shifted into the Baltimore region. This placed Northern Virginia, the District and central Maryland on the unstable and humid side of the front, with winds from the south.The total available moisture content in the atmospheric column — as measured by the morning weather balloon in Sterling, Virginia — was around 2.2 inches, nearly a record for the day in July. The atmosphere became more and more primed through the afternoon, south of the front, for storms to wring out this excessive moisture.As the image below shows, about 5 p.m., a narrow band of thunderstorms erupted along the southern border of the front, across northern Fairfax County, lower Montgomery County, northern D.C. and northern Prince George’s County. The complex, as a whole, remained nearly stationary for a couple hours. But individual storm cells repeatedly developed on the western side and moved through the larger cloud complex, toward the east, generating a succession of cells passing over the same areas. This phenomenon is termed “echo training.”Rain totals very rapidly added up across this narrow zone, as nearly a dozen flash flood warnings were rushed out.More downpours amid a historically humid summerSaturday’s downpours occurred amid an unusually humid and stormy stretch that began in June. It has been the second-most humid summer on record and flooding thunderstorms have occurred repeatedly.AdvertisementWhen the Weather Service issued a flood watch for the region late Saturday afternoon, it marked the 16th since May, which is the most on record during a three-month period. The D.C. area has seen more flood watches than any other major city this year.Because of human-caused climate change, which speeds up evaporation, the amount of available moisture in the air has increased in recent decades. A measure of atmospheric moisture, known as precipitable water, has steadily increased since the late the 1970s. The increased moisture raises the ceiling for the amount and intensity of rainfall.After another humid and potentially stormy day on Sunday, the region expects a reprieve early next week as cooler and drier air settles in, at least briefly.Dan Stillman, Ben Noll and Ian Livingston contributed to this report.

      "Full content: KERRVILLE, Texas — Just three people remain missing — down from nearly 100 at last count — since the Texas Hill Country was pounded by massive flooding on July 4, officials said Saturday.Officials praised rescuers for the sharp reduction in the number of people on the missing list; just days after the catastrophic flooding, more than 160 people were said to be unaccounted for in Kerr County alone.\"This remarkable progress reflects countless hours of coordinated search and rescue operations, careful investigative work, and an unwavering commitment to bringing clarity and hope to families during an unimaginably difficult time,\" Kerrville City manager Dalton Rice said in a statement.The death toll in Kerr County, 107, held steady for much of this week even as the intensive search continued.The flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas over the holiday weekend, with most deaths along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, about 60 miles northwest of San Antonio.Just before daybreak on July 4, the destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet on the Guadalupe, washing away homes and vehicles.The floods laid waste to the Hill Country, a popular tourist destination where campers seek out spots along the river amid the rolling landscape. It is naturally prone to flash flooding because its dry, dirt-packed soil cannot soak up heavy rain.Vacation cabins and youth camps campgrounds fill the riverbanks and hills of Kerr County, including Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian summer camp for girls. Located in a low-lying area of a region known as \"flash flood alley,\" Camp Mystic lost at least 27 campers and counselors.The flooding was far more severe than the 100-year event envisioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, experts said, and it moved so quickly in the middle of the night that it caught many off guard in a county that lacked a warning system.In Kerrville, about 100 miles west of Austin, local officials have come under scrutiny over whether residents were adequately warned about the rising waters.President Donald Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have pushed back aggressively against questions about how well local authorities responded to forecasts of heavy rain and the first reports of flash flooding.Crews have been searching for victims using helicopters, boats and drones. Earlier efforts were hampered by rain forecasts, leading some crews to hold off or stop because of worries about more flooding.×PhotosRelated storiesTrump visits Texas flood zone, defends government's disaster responseSchumer wants probe of National Weather Service response in TexasMost recent U.S. storiesMemory cafes ignite laughter and connection for dementia patientsMicrosoft to stop using engineers in China for tech support of US military; Hegseth orders reviewNew airport scanners are better at spotting liquid explosives, but many airports lack themRelated topicsU.S.Associated PressMore stories you may be interested in\n",

      "During WWII, Larson was deployed to Ireland, and then on June 6, 1944, he was one of 34,000 Allied soldiers to storm Omaha Beach during the D-Day invasion of German-occupied Normandy. In recent years, Larson's posts on social media, with the help of his family, have gained him a global following. His TikTok page, with the handle @storytimewithpapajake, has 1.2 million followers and his posts have more than 11 million likes. He also has more than 16,000 subscribers on YouTube. His recollections of the moment he landed on Omaha Beach — where he escaped enemy machine gun fire — as well as other memories of fighting in the war have garnered millions of views across different social media platforms. \"It seemed like that the landing was an eternity, with all the firing going on.... I can't describe it. And people say, 'Were you scared?' I was scared of stepping on a landmine, and that's what I was trying to prevent,\" Larson said in a video posted by the U.S. Army last month. \"I was 5 foot 7 at that time.

Photograph: Karam Al-Masri/ReutersSyria‘Tense calm’ returns to Syria’s Sweida province after week of deadly violenceMore than 1,000 people estimated to have been killed after clashes between Bedouin and Druze groupsJennifer Rankin and agenciesSun 20 Jul 2025 08.20 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 15.20 EDTShareAn uneasy calm returned to southern Syria’s Sweida province on Sunday, after fighters withdrew following a week of violence estimated to have killed more than 1,000 people.Local people told news agencies the area was calm after Syria’s Islamist-led government said Bedouin fighters had left the predominantly Druze city.The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Sweida had been experiencing “a cautious calm since the early hours of Sunday morning”, but warned of “the deterioration of the humanitarian situation” including a severe shortage of basic medical supplies.The SOHR reported on Sunday that more than 1,000 people had been killed in armed clashes, bombardment, extrajudicial executions and Israeli airstrikes since the violence in Sweida province began a week ago. The United Nations migration agency said the number of people displaced by the violence had risen to more than 128,000.One local resident, dentist Kenan Azzam, told Reuters on Sunday morning the situation was one of “a tense calm” but people were still struggling with a lack of water and electricity. “The hospitals are a disaster and out of service, and there are still so many dead and wounded,” he said.Agence France-Presse correspondents on the outskirts of Sweida city reported there were no sounds of fighting, adding humanitarian convoys were preparing to enter the Druze-majority town.Escalating unrest in Syria lays bare new regime’s momentous challenges Read moreThe Syrian Arab Red Crescent humanitarian organisation announced it was sending 32 trucks to Sweida loaded with food, medicine, water, fuel and other aid, after the fighting left the province with power cuts and shortages. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the health ministry was also sending a convoy of trucks.The violence was triggered by a dispute between a Bedouin tribesman and a member of the Druze, who are a minority in wider Syria, which prompted government forces to intervene. Druze fighters resisted their entry into the province and violence escalated, turning into days of terror for local people. In response, Israel, which has vowed to protect the Druze community, launched airstrikes on Syria’s defence ministry in Damascus and dozens of military targets in the south of the country.View image in fullscreenMembers of Syria’s Internal Security Forces stand guard at a checkpoint set up to prevent Bedouin fighters from advancing towards Sweida on Sunday. Photograph: Karam Almasri/ReutersA ceasefire agreement between Syria and Israel had been announced by the US early on Saturday to prevent further Israeli military intervention.Early on Sunday, the US stepped up calls for an end to the fighting. “All factions must immediately lay down their arms, cease hostilities, and abandon cycles of tribal vengeance,” the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, wrote on X. “Syria stands at a critical juncture – peace and dialogue must prevail – and prevail now.”A few hours earlier, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, issued a warning to Syria’s new government, whose forces have been accused by Druze factions of committing abuses, including summary executions, when they entered Sweida earlier in the week.Rubio wrote on X: “If authorities in Damascus want to preserve any chance of achieving a unified, inclusive and peaceful Syria free of Isis [Islamic State] and of Iranian control they must help end this calamity by using their security forces to prevent Isis and any other violent jihadists from entering the area and carrying out massacres. And they must hold accountable and bring to justice anyone guilty of atrocities including those in their own ranks.”MapTwo members of the government forces posted sectarian hate speech against Druze, according to private social media seen by the Guardian’s correspondent in Beirut.One posted a video of him and two other soldiers driving through Sweida laughing as he said: “We are on our way to distribute aid,” while brandishing a machete to the camera. He filmed himself inside a house in Sweida ripping a picture of Druze spiritual leaders off a wall and trampling it with his boots.The last week has been the worst outbreak of violence since March, when 1,500 mostly Alawite citizens were massacred in revenge for a failed attack by supporters of the ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad, who came from the sect.The second round of sectarian violence has tempered international hopes for the new Syrian government, which came to power last December after the sudden fall of the Assad regime. Western governments, the US, the UK and the EU, lifted sanctions in an effort to aid Syria’s battered economy and economic reconstruction, after 13 years of civil war and repression by the Assad regime, which killed more than half a million people, leaving 90% of the population in poverty.The EU said on Saturday it was “appalled by the hundreds of victims” of the recent violence, including that “reportedly perpetrated by several armed groups against unarmed civilians”. In a statement, the EU foreign service urged “all parties to immediately stop all acts of violence, to protect all civilians without distinction, and to take immediate steps to prevent incitement and sectarian discourse”.The EU also called on “Israel and all other foreign actors to fully respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, on Saturday announced a ceasefire in Sweida and renewed his promise to protect Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities.Sharaa, who was more sympathetic to the Bedouins, had tried to appeal to the Druze community while remaining critical of the militias. He later urged the Bedouins to leave the city, saying they “cannot replace the role of the state in handling the country’s affairs and restoring security”.The interior ministry said overnight that Sweida city was “evacuated of all tribal fighters, and clashes within the city’s neighbourhoods were halted”.A spokesperson for Syria’s tribal and clan council told Al Jazeera late on Saturday that fighters had left the city “in response to the call of the presidency and the terms of the agreement”.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content\n",

      "Full content: By  Annabelle TimsitA typhoon disrupted travel around Hong Kong and southern China on Sunday, causing widespread flight cancellations and forcing people to seek shelter during strong gusts and heavy rain.Typhoon Wipha — which started as a tropical storm and was declared a typhoon overnight — brought “heavy squally showers,” high sea swells and maximum sustained winds of 62 mph to Hong Kong by Sunday afternoon, the territory’s Weather Observatory said.By early evening, China’s meteorological agency said Wipha had made landfall in southern Guangdong province, weakening as it moved west. But Hong Kong’s Weather Observatory warned residents to stay on alert for its potential aftereffects, including “gale to storm force southeasterly winds” and high sea swells.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementIn Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post reported that 253 people sought refuge in government shelters and 26 went to public hospitals for medical treatment because of the storm. The SCMP said there were 471 reports of fallen trees, with photos showing one that had crushed a car.Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority said it canceled all services at its general outpatient clinics.Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, said it delayed or canceled all inbound flights before 6 p.m. Sunday. In an early-evening update, it said it expected to resume departing flights once adverse weather subsided.Hong Kong International Airport said it suspended its SkyPier Terminal service connecting Hong Kong with several Chinese cities and Macao.Classes were canceled at schools, and Hong Kong Disneyland closed because of the storm.Wipha made landfall in Taishan, a city in the southwest of Guangdong province, around 5:50 p.m. Sunday, according to China’s National Meteorological Center. Shortly after it landed, it weakened from typhoon strength to a strong tropical storm, the agency said, adding that Wipha was expected to gradually weaken as it moved along the western coast of Guangdong, before making another landfall on the northern coast of Vietnam late Monday.AdvertisementAdvertisementEarlier on Sunday, Wipha prompted Hong Kong’s Weather Observatory to issue its highest warning level, a Hurricane Signal No. 10. But the agency downgraded the warning later in the day and said winds were weakening and the storm was “departing from Hong Kong gradually.” Still, it said it will issue a No. 3 Strong Wind Signal at 7:40 p.m. on Sunday.The storm was approaching Vietnam late Sunday and threatened to bring flooding conditions and dangerous weather by Monday, the U.S. Embassy there said, citing the Vietnamese National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. The embassy said Wipha could “bring heavy rain and strong, damaging winds to affected areas” as well as “extensive flooding and mudslides” starting Monday.The extreme weather came the same weekend as dozens died in Vietnam’s Ha Long Bay after a boat carrying 46 Vietnamese tourists and three crew members capsized overnight after encountering a sudden storm, according to state media reports.Wipha also caused heavy storms in Taiwan on Saturday and intensified the southwest monsoon rains in the Philippines, according to the country’s Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. The agency said it expected moderate and light rains and thunderstorms to continue in parts of the country into Monday. Thousands took shelter in government facilities, and two people were missing because of the storm, the Philippine Star reported.

      "Full content: Economy·HousingTop economist sounds the alarm even louder on the housing market and says homebuilders are ‘giving up’By Jason MaBy Jason MaWeekend EditorJason MaWeekend EditorJason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing.SEE FULL BIO Single-family housing starts dropped 4.6% in June, with permits down as well.Getty ImagesWith mortgage rates remaining high and looking unlikely to drop much anytime soon, the housing market outlook is quickly deteriorating. Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said he thinks a “red flare” is more appropriate for housing, just weeks after he sent off a “yellow flare.” Unless mortgage rates come down substantially, home sales, homebuilding and prices will slump, he warned.\n",
      "The housing market is getting so weak that it’s poised to become a significant drag on overall economic growth, according to Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi.\n",
      "In a series of posts on X last week, he noted that he sent off a “yellow flare” on the housing market just a few weeks ago but now thinks a “red flare” is more appropriate as the outlook is already deteriorating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Home sales, homebuilding, and even house prices are set to slump unless mortgage rates decline materially from their current near 7% soon,” Zandi warned. “That, however, seems unlikely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing home sales unexpectedly rose in May, but still marked the slowest sales pace for any May since 2009, further evidence that the typically busy spring selling season has been a bust.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, sales of new single-family homes sank 13.7% in May from the prior month, and single-family housing starts dropped 4.6% in June, with permits down as well.\n",
      "“Home sales are already uber depressed, but homebuilders providing rate buydowns had been propping sales up,” Zandi said. “They are giving up. It’s simply too expensive. A big tell is that many builders are delaying their land purchases from the land banks. New home sales, starts, and completions will soon fall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He added that home prices had also held up well, but are now going sideways and set to turn lower as near-7% mortgage rates crush demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the latest Case-Shiller home price report showed a 0.3% monthly fall in the 20-city index in April, steeper than March’s downwardly revised 0.2% dip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And the latest Housing Market Index survey from the National Association of Home Builders showed 38% of builders cut prices in July, up from 37% in June, 34% in May, and 29% in April.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting more downward pressure on prices is increased supply. Home listings have been climbing, as even homeowners with low, pre-pandemic mortgage rates eventually need to put those properties up for sale and buy new homes at higher rates.\n",
      "“Given their demographic and job situations, locked-in homeowners must move,” Zandi added. “They can only work around these needs for so long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditions are so tepid that many homeowners who listed their properties are taking them off the market after failing to find a buyer at the price they were offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Delistings are up 35% year to date and 47% year over year in May, outpacing active listing growth of 28.4% and 31.5%, respectively, according to a Realtor.com report this month.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For Zandi, that all adds up to bad news for the overall economy, which is already feeling strains from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Housing will thus soon be a full-blown headwind to broader economic growth, adding to the growing list of reasons to be worried about the economy’s prospects later this year and early next,” he said.\n",
      "Analysts at Citi Research issued a similar warning in May, when they pointed out that the economist Ed Leamer, who passed away in February, famously published a paper in 2007 that said residential investment is the best leading indicator of an oncoming recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Citi pointed to fewer permits for single-family-home construction and an increase in the effective supply of homes on the market amid weak demand. Median home prices of existing homes were also falling on a monthly basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Residential fixed investment is the most interest rate sensitive sector in the economy and is now signaling that mortgage rates around 7% are too high to sustain an expansion,” Citi said.\n",
